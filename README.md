This code implements a Quantum Diffusion Model (QDM) based on the paper by Cacioppo et al. 


The model uses parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) in place of traditional artificial neural networks to generate quantum states. The implementation presents a hybrid approach, with a classical forward process and a quantum backward process, using the Reverse-Bottleneck architecture. A latent version of the model has been created, with conditioning capabilities. The model was implemented using PennyLane and tested on the MNIST dataset.
